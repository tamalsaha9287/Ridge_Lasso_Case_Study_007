## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- Objective is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not

- Final model that has been considered in through Lasso
